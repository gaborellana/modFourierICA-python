# modFourierICA-python
This repo is the python reimplementation of the code developed for my thesis, [Independent component analysis of distributed source modeled EEG data](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/351474383_Independent_component_analysis_of_distributed_source_modeled_EEG_data), which can be seen as two projects:
1) Modification of [FourierICA](https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/group/neuroinf/code/fourierica/html/fourierica.html), adding a step of normalization over the spectral data, improving the separation of sources. 
2) Developing algorithms for simulation of realistic EEG data, focusing on realistic behavior of data in the spectral domain. 

The example available here shows the use of regular FourierICA implemented in python (originally implemented in MATLAB), as well as the modified version.
